# Getting Started with Create React App

This repository is the bare minimum code needed to make React.js work. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The benefit of using this repository over `create-react-app` is that it removes verbose code. As such, it's easier to understand how to code in React, and beginners might find thsi repository best :)
